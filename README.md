# Android-Programming-Studies
Hi, This Repo is to Track on my Android Programming Studies. There will be a lot of small projects, a lot of simple writings regarding the topic that I'm trying to learn, and the list goes on.

I will try to document my learning journey. Furthermore, This is not my university course, so I will be using a lot of resources (and ofc I will document it)! For example, I am using:
- <a href = "https://dicoding.com">Dicoding</a>
- <a href = "https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course">Google Course</a>
- and many more
